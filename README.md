AthenaOfDelphi's Library
==

This repository contains the parts of my Delphi library that I am making publicly available.

It is offered under the MPL (Version 2.0), details of which can be found in LICENSE.

I will try to break the library up into sensible directories as items are added.  For now, there is only one.  Each section may be further divided to keep related items (e.g. usage examples) together.

## Sections ##

- **GameDevelopment** - Units and classes that may prove useful if you are writing games with Delphi

Further information about the contents of each section can be found in the README.md for that section.  Usage information can be found in either an associated README or within the source itself.

## Support ##

I'm a full time software engineer who is busy studying for a degree.  Couple that with the fact I have a few personal software projects on the go, and I don't have a lot of time to provide support so, like my WordPress plug-ins, it's offered on a 'when I can' basis.

If you would like to report an issue with the code I provide here, then please do so using the Github issue tracker.  If you require urgent assistance then you may email at **athena at outer hyphen reaches dot com**.

When reporting issues, please provide as much information as you can.
